WIP Realism Overhaul support for the Bluedog Design Bureau Mod

**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS**:
  1: Install RealismOverhaul (CKAN Express Install or manual, doesn't matter) and BDB
  2: Open the RealismOverhaul Folder inside the GameData Folder
  3: Open the RO_SuggestedMods Folder inside the RealismOverhaul Folder
  4: **DELETE** the Bluedog_DB Folder inside the RO_SuggestedMods Folder (This will remove the old configs)
  5: Back out to the GameData Folder and copy the RealismOverhaul folder provided in this download into it (This will place the new configs into the RO Folder)
  6: **OPTIONAL BDB ENGINE INCLUSION (SEE BELOW)**
  7: Done, load up the game and have fun

**IF YOU WANT BDB ENGINES (OPTIONAL)**:
Note: If you go through with this, not only will BDB engines appear, but all engines from other mods that would otherwise be duplicates, you will likely need a part tab manager like Janitor's Closet.

  6.1: Open the ROEngines Folder inside the GameData Folder
  6.2: Delete the PatchManager Folder

NOTES:

- This download includes Full Support for BDB and will keep up with Development Updates as time goes on.

- This is a Beta Download, there are bugs and not everything is 100% complete, but everything here should work.

- RP1 not supported.
