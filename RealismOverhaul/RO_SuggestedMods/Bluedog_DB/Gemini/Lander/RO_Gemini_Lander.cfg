	@description = Descent tank for the Gemini Lander system. Place under the engine and adjust upwards to rest just under the lander can. The descent stage can decouple using a built in decoupler. Meant to have 4x legs attached, but you can probably get away with less if you are brave. The ladder can be toggled in the VAB for uncrewed landers.

	@manufacturer = Langley Research Center
	@description = While Professor Wernher was looking for his golf clubs, we were working on this landing leg for the Gemini lander system. Attach in 4x symmetry to the descent stage. Swings downwards before locking into place - while this improves stability, it means there is no suspension system to absorb impacts.

	@manufacturer = McDonnell Aircraft
	@description = This special docking port is designed to capture the Gemini nose cone docking mechanism. The simple mechanical connection will not even allow you to transfer resources, much less crew, but it will securely attach two vessels together, for berthing or travel. This low profile model needs to be deployed in order to dock. Be warned, it is not as forgiving as its larger sibling.

	@manufacturer = Langley Research Center
	@description = This extremely small capsule is darn near the smallest capsule you can make to hold a single kerbal. Contains just enough supplies and features to enable a short romp down to the surface and back. Its pressurized cockpit makes it (slightly) safer than an external command seat, though there isn't room to take off one's helmet. Please peruse the other Gemini Lander parts in order to turn this capsule into a complete lander system.

A single example is used as both the descent and ascent engine of the Gemini lander, using the empty toroidal descent stage tank as a takeoff platform.
