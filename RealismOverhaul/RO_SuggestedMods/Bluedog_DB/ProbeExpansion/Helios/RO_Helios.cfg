Place a sun shade above and below (flip the lower shade over) to form an hourglass shape, and then attach the experiment arms and RPWS antennas.

	@description = Large magnetometer on an extending arm for the Helios spacecraft, created as a joint project between NASA and The West German DFLVR. Place one on each side of the Helios probe core on the mounting plates provided. Includes two different variants of magnetometer. We can not figure out if anything is different between them, but it sure does look cool to have two different kinds.

	@description = RPWS whip antenna for the Helios spacecraft, created as a joint project between NASA and The West German DFLVR. Place one on each side of the Helios probe core on the mounting plates provided. Do note that while it technically works with only one antenna, using at least two would theoretically provide much better data.

	@description = Large, conical 1.5m to 2.4m adapter for the Helios spacecraft, created as a joint project between NASA and The West German DFLVR. Place above and below the Helios probe core (flip the bottom one over to make an hourglass shape). Attach the dish on top and a Star-37FMV underneath. Contains a mix of solar cells and reflective surfaces to reject heat while providing sufficient electrical power.
