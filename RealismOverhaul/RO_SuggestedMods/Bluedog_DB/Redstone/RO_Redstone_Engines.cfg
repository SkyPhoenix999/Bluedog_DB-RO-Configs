	@description = This primitive booster engine was originally designed to run on alcolox. Initially used on the Redstone ballistic missile, the engine would later be upgraded to use a more volatine Hydyne fuel. The engine was also used on the Mercury Redstone launch vehicle but the designers went back to the safer although less performant Alcolox mix. This bare version has no gimbal ability.

	@description = This primitive booster engine was originally designed to run on alcolox. Initially used on the Redstone ballistic missile, the engine would later be upgraded to use a more volatine Hydyne fuel. The engine was also used on the Mercury Redstone launch vehicle but the designers went back to the safer although less performant Alcolox mix. Packaged together with an engine shroud, this version lets you "gimbal" using the built in vanes that deflect the engine exhaust.
