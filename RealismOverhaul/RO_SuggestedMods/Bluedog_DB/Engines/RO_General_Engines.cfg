	@manufacturer = Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
	@description = An extrememe performance evolution of the basic expander bleed cycle, this engine uses upstream boost pumps to achieve high turbo-pump and chamber pressures and produces double the thrust of a typical closed expander cycle engine. By injecting the bleed exhaust back into the nozzle for film cooling, some of the Isp loss from using the bleed cycle is also recovered. The end result is a no compromise upper stage engine.
