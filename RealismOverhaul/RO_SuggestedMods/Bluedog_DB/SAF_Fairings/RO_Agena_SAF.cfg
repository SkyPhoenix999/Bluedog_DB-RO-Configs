	@title = Strawman Satellite Bus Fairing SAF
	@description = The Strawman Bus is intended to push Agena-based satellites' life and capabilities to their full potential. Not only does this bus expand the Agena's profile from 1.5m to 2m, it also introduces redundant systems, intregated batteries, a built-in fairing, and a new state-of-the-art solid-state data recording system. While intended to be a platform for signals intelligence reconnaissance collection, this bus can be used for any number of applications with the Agena upper stage and beyond. This version supports simple adjustable fairings.
