	@description = 4m dual payload adapter for the Commercial Titan III. This innovative device has an integrated fairing on top and has room to carry another payload underneath. First attach your lower payload to the stock version of the 4m Titan IIIC Adapter Base and then place this on top. The adapter needs to be manually decoupled in the part action window after the upper payload has deployed.
