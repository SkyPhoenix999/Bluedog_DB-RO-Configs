	@description = A small, 1m decoupler designed especially for deploying a satellite from the launch vehicle. Rather than using explosive bolts to separate the part above it, a spring loaded plate gently pushes the payload away. This one is taller than most, for payloads that need a large standoff from the upper stage below. Additional height (needed for solar panels or instruments hanging below the bottom plane of the payload, for example) can be gained by attaching structural payload adapters to the bottom.
